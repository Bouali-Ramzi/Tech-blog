You can use the zoom property in css to scale deferent content or items inside the HTML and make it big or small, i don't recomand using it in live sites.

you can controle element size with this example

```css
.zoom {
  zoom: 0.5;
}
```

or scale the element twice the size with this example

```css
.zoom {
  zoom: 2;
}
```

you can use the percentage value
